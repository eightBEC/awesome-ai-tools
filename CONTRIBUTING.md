# Contributing to Awesome AI Tools

Thanks for helping improve this repository! We aim to maintain a **high-quality, topic-oriented** list.

## How to Contribute

1. **Check** existing sections to avoid duplicates.
2. **Choose the right topic** and add your entry.
3. **Use this format**:
   - `**Tool Name** — short, neutral description (≤ 12 words): URL`
4. **Prefer canonical links** (official docs, GitHub).
5. **Open a Pull Request** with a clear title (e.g., `Add: AIF360 to Governance`).

## Quality Guidelines

- **Alphabetical order** within each subsection.
- **Concise descriptions** — avoid marketing superlatives.
- **Reputable sources** — avoid broken links or unmaintained projects.

## Adding New Topics

Propose new topics via an **Issue** first. Include:

- Rationale and scope
- Example entries
- How it differs from existing topics

## Pull Request Checklist

- [ ] Entry is under the correct topic and subsection
- [ ] Name and description follow format and are neutral
- [ ] Link is canonical and publicly accessible (or marked internal)
- [ ] Alphabetical order preserved within subsection
- [ ] Markdown lint passes (no trailing spaces, proper bullets)

## Maintenance & Hygiene

- Run link checkers (e.g., `markdown-link-check`) in CI where possible.
- Use labels like `good first issue`, `help wanted`, `needs review`.
- Maintain a **CHANGELOG.md** for notable additions (optional).

## Code of Conduct

Please be respectful and constructive.
